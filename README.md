# Back-end (MVC5) to Client (?) rendering

## About this project
This is a work in progress on a proof of concept for a macaw solution with MVC, in which the template rendering is done both server side and client side.

## End goals
* An architecture that is modular
* Separation of live-view and editing-view
* Ability to switch variants client-side
* Render a basic html variant initially
* Render to RDFa & JSON

# Todo
* Finish POC
* Write documentation
